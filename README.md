# Electric-Vehicle-Population-Classification
Machine learning project on classification of electric vehicle type.

<font size="5">Background</font>
<p style='text-align: justify;'> With the burgeoning electric vehicle market, precise classification of electric vehicle types becomes pivotal for stakeholders such as manufacturers, policymakers, and consumers. This project addresses the growing need for accurate categorization of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) to inform infrastructure planning, policy formulation, and targeted market strategies, thereby contributing to the evolution of electric vehicle research and decision-making processes.</p>

<font size="5">Objective</font>
<p style='text-align: justify;'> This project aims to develop a robust classification model capable of accurately differentiating between BEVs and PHEVs. The primary goal is to gain comprehensive insights into the distribution and characteristics of these electric vehicle types, empowering stakeholders with valuable information for informed decision-making in the realms of infrastructure development, policy implementation, and market targeting.</p>
